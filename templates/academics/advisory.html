                            <p>The college has an efficient staff advisory system. Each batch of students of a particular year has at least two staff advisors for their guidance and overall support. A separate Senior Staff Coordinator is assigned for each year of students for their overall supervision. A staff advisor, assigned by the concerned department, will be in charge of the first year students. One staff member is assigned for a group of 20 students. The student records along with their academic progress, all extra-curricular activities and daily attendance are managed by the advisors who inform the parents/guardians in case of setback in any area. All matters, academic and otherwise, pertaining to the students are timely routed through the staff advisor for the attention of the authorities. Applications for leave, scholarships, certificates etc. are to be forwarded through the advisor. Parents can get details about their children from the staff advisors and are advised to contact the advisor for any purpose relating to their wards.</p>
