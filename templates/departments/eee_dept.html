                        <p>The Post Graduate programme on Power Systems was started with the idea of imparting the techniques of adapting the existing power system to distributed generation. The M.Techin Power Systems will give timely skills and specialist knowledge required to significantly enhance the career prospects in the electrical power industry. The duration of this Post Graduate Programme is 2 years (4 semesters).The first and second semesters are devoted to theory, seminar and laboratory sessions. The third semester is a blend of theory courses, Industrial visits and Mini project. The fourth semester is dedicated to a full scale project. Every student is required to submit a thesis/dissertation based on the project undertaken in partial fulfillment of the requirement for the award of the Master’s degree. The program goal is to provide an education that is directly applicable to a career in industry and is suitable for a new or recent graduate, as well as experienced professionals, who want to receive the necessary retraining to change careers. With the advent of power electronic devices, the contemporary power system has changed and has taken a new direction.</p>
