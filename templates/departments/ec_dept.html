                        <p>The department offers UG and PG Courses which are designed to give students both theoretical
                            and practical knowledge in all frontier areas of Electronics and Communication.The
                            department has been conducting M Tech course in Microwave &amp; TV Engineering (2 Years)
                            since 2011 onwards.
                            The curriculum of B.Tech - Electronics and Communication is designed to give adequate
                            emphasis on the Analog and Digital processing of information for efficient communication.
                            The core program is supplemented and further reinforced by a well-chosen set of elective
                            courses permitting the students to specialize either in the software or the hardware aspect
                            of Communication. The Department of Electronics and Communication, started in the year 2002,
                            aims to educate students from different cultural, social, economic and geographical
                            locations, so that they become enlightened individuals, improving the living standards of
                            their families, industry and society by providing individual attention. The department of
                            ECE shares the mission and vision of the institute in imparting quality education to the
                            students. First, it is ensured that the students perceive the electronic fundamentals
                            thoroughly. Then, while fulfilling the requirements of the syllabus prescribed by the
                            University, the course goes much further and offers students the opportunity to work on
                            diverse hardware and software platforms. Students are encouraged to join professional

                        <h2 class="heading3">Electronics Workshop</h2>
                        <p>The ultimate aim of the lab is to make the students familiarized with various electronic
                            components, devices and equipments. The lab also has emphasis on soldering practices in the
                            construction of Printed Circuit Board (PCB).</p>

                        <h2 class="heading3">Electronic Devices Lab</h2>
                        <p>The primary objective of the lab is to serve as a platform for understanding the operating
                            principles of electronic devices through experiments and also to study their
                            characteristics. The students are trained in designing, implementing and testing the analog
                            electronic circuits.</p>

                        <h2 class="heading3">Electronics Circuit Lab</h2>
                        <p>The students design components for analog and pulse circuits. They construct the circuit and
                            test them to study the impact of various design parameters and compare their performance.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="heading3">Communication Engineering and System lab</h2>
                        <p>The primary objective of the Communication Engineering lab is to familiarize the students
                            with all analog communication systems. The students conduct experiments to modulate as well
                            as to demodulate the signals using different modulation techniques.

                            The Communication Systems lab focuses on various digital communication techniques at
                            hardware level as well as software levels using simulation languages like MATLAB, Simulink

                        <p>Various experiments are conducted on Microwave test benches in X band. The lab includes
                            various characteristic study using microwave sources like Klystron oscillators and Gunn
                            diode. The experiments involve studying of varying losses using different wave guides and
                            frequency measurements using several microwave antennas like horn antenna.</p>

                        <h2 class="heading3">Optical Communication Lab</h2>
                        <p>In optical fiber communication, lab experiments are conducted on how light is used to
                            transmit information on a fiber optic link. It is done by using LASER as well as LED sources
                            in single mode and multimode optical fibers. By using suitable experimental kits, Numerical
                            Aperture and V-number as well as several losses like attenuation and dispersion losses of
                            any optical fiber can also be measured. The advanced OTDR set up is available in the lab for
                            conducting the experiments to locate the fault in the fiber and also for doing the
                            experiments related to WDM.</p>

                        <h2 class="heading3">Industrial Electronics Lab</h2>
                        <p>The primary objective of the lab is to serve as platform for understanding the operating
                            principles of Power electronic devices through experiment and also to study their
                            characteristics. The students are trained in designing, constructing and testing the power
                            electronic circuits using SCR, MOSFET, TRIAC, IGBT, POWER BJT and LDR.</p>

                        <h2 class="heading3">Digital Signal Processing Lab</h2>
                        <p>Digital signal processing Lab emphasizes the study and processing of various signals using
                            digital techniques. The experiments are conducted using simulation language like MATLAB and
                            Simulation Tool such as SIMULINK. The experiments with DSP kits using Virtual Lab setup
                            called LABVIEW are also conducted.</p>
